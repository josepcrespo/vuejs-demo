# Vue.js Demo

This is a small project to demo my skills on modern front end web development and the tools stack used in a usual workflow. A Single Page Application (aka SPA) built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (a modern JavaScript framework) for coding the business logic and the user interaction.
